                        <p>As hematologists, we work within the Medical Services Plan. This means that you need to be referred by another doctor (usually your family doctor) or nurse practitioner to see us.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>We do not do blood tests in the office. Depending on what you were referred about, you may have had blood tests ordered by your health care provider. If we need to repeat any blood tests to check for changes or order new tests, you will be informed of this. A request will be sent to your local lab in time for you to have the blood drawn so that we have the results available for your appointment.</p>

                        <p>Video conference and phone visits can often be used for both your initial consultation and any follow-up appointments. For people outside the central Okanagan, these allow you to avoid long distance travel to physically meet us. They also allow you to avoid unnecessary contact during the current pandemic so we use them even for locals. When we see you by video, we can assess your general condition but cannot examine you properly. For some problems where an examination is important, we prefer an in-person visit. With a phone visit, we are even more limited as we cannot assess what you look like (or interact with your smiling face). If these are appropriate for you, they will be discussed with you when your appointment is booked. There are two types of videoconferencing available - Virtual visit and Telehealth.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>Telehealth is an option that does not require you to have any technology. However,  you need to be able to travel to a local centre that has the equipment. All hospitals and many health centres in smaller towns have access to this through their regional health authority. Family members/support people can be in the room with you though many of the rooms are small. It is very reliable and secure. There is competition with other health care providers using the system and some facilities only have it available certain days so it can sometimes be tricky arranging a time that works.</p>

                        <p>When a referral is received from your health care provider, it is reviewed by one of our doctors. Based on the information provided, we decide how quickly the issue needs to be addressed. Do not be alarmed if your appointment is far in the future. This means that it is unlikely a serious problem and not likely to get a lot worse before we are able to see you. If there is a reason you think you need to be seen sooner, please discuss this with your health care provider and they call call us to discuss the new information. Similarly, do not be alarmed if we arrange to see you quickly. Sometimes, this just means we do not have enough information to know if the issue is serious. Sometimes, we need to discuss your problem early in its course to be sure you understand what it is and develop a follow-up plan.</p>

                        <p>If you have concerns about your ability to understand or remember what is discussed during your appointment, it is a good idea to bring along a family member or other support person to help. Bringing a list of your medications and past medical problems is a good idea. We do not always get this information from you health care provider. A list or picture of your medications is better than bringing the actual pill bottles as you won't forget or lose them if they stay at home.</p>

                        <p>A limited number of patients are being seen in the office. This is only the case if deemed medically necessary by your doctor. In order to keep everyone as safe as possible, the following procedures will be followed for anyone scheduled to have an in-office visit.


                            <p>Please call the office as soon as possible if you have RECENTLY developed any of the following symptoms: shortness of breath, sore throat, stuffy or runny nose, coughing, sneezing, headache, muscle ache, fatigue, chills, fever or loss of appetite.  We will either convert your appointment to a phone/virtual visit or rebook for a later time.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>You should come alone unless you require assistance because of  physical or mental challenges. A maximum of 1 accompanying person will be allowed in this situation.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>You will not be allowed entry to the office until 5 minutes before your appointment time.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>Before entering the office, you should be wearing your mask and you will be required to use our hand sanitizer. All surfaces contacted by visitors will be sanitized between visits. Office staff will be behind a shield and doctors will be wearing masks and put on gloves if necessary. All visitors will go directly to an examination room once checked in.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>Use of the public washroom on our floor is “at your own risk”.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>Once you have read these protocols, please email info@company.com  or call us at 020-060-0260 to acknowledge that you accept and will abide by them.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>If seen in the office, you will be directed to one of our examination rooms. For virtual visits, the appropriate virtual connection will be made. The doctor will ask you to describe your symptoms or problem. She or he will ask a number of questions about the problem and your general health. This provides most of the information we need to help sort out the issue of concern. A list of your past and current medical problems as well as current medications is useful to have with you (we sometimes do not get this information from your health care provider). If relevant and you are in office, you will be examined. Once this has been completed, the doctor will discuss with you what the diagnosis is and explain what needs to be done or will propose a plan of investigation or monitoring. Feel free to ask questions at any time during your visit. We believe you need to have appropriate information to make decisions about your health care options.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>Initial consultation visits are booked for 30 or 45 minutes. Follow-up visits are usually booked for 15 minutes. Your actual time with the doctor my be less depending on the complexity  of your problems and number of questions you may have. </p>

                        <p>Once the visit is over, there will be a plan in place. If you need blood tests or other investigations, you will advised about timing and a requisition will be sent for the test. If a follow-up appointment is needed, it will usually be booked at that time.</p>


                            <p>If you think of questions you forgot to ask during your visit, please call back to the office. We can often deal with these over the phone. If a lot needs to be discussed, we may arrange another appointment.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>If you have a future appointment, you will get a reminder ahead of time. Please contact us if you are not able to make the appointment. If we requested blood tests be done prior to your visit, a requisition should already be waiting at the lab for you.</p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>If you are interested in getting your recent lab results, there are a couple of ways to go about this.</p>


                            <p>If you are new to monitoring your blood results, the simplest thing is to call the office and leave a message. Your doctor will call you back to give you the results. This allows the opportunity to ask questions about what the numbers mean in your circumstances.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>If you are comfortable following and interpreting your own results, direct access is now easier than ever.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>Most labs in the province - including Valley Labs (serving Vernon, Kelowna and Penticton), Lifelabs (serving Kamloops), as well as private and outpatient hospital labs on the lower mainland - send their results to a secure and confidential provincial database. This is accessible through <a href="https://www.myehealth.ca">my ehealth</a>. There is a registration process described on the website. You require your CareCard number, a valid e-mail address, and must have been to the lab within the last 30 days to register. If you request it when at the lab, a lab visit number will be given to you that can be used to register. If you do not have a lab visit number, a special access PIN will be sent to you by regular mail to complete your registration. Once you have your account set up, you can use it to access the last 3 months of your lab results online.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>The labs at Interior Health facilities including hospitals and health care centres do not participate in the provincial system. To get results, from these facilities, you need to register for <a href="https://www.interiorhealth.ca/YourHealth/MyHealthPortal/Pages/default.aspx">My HealthPortal</a>. To do so, you must have had your e-mail registered in your patient record when at one of the IH facilities (for instance at the lab). Once the online request form has been submitted, you will be called to complete the registration process. When registered, you can log in to access your labs and imaging (x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI) results.</p>
                            
                            
                            <p>If you have questions or concerns after reviewing online results of tests that we have ordered, please call the office and we will discuss them with you.</p>

                        <p>We are taking precautions to keep the office as safe as possible for both patients and staff. All relevant guidelines from provincial authorities are being followed. To limit exposures, we are booking mostly video or phone appointments.  In office, a number of staff procedures have been put in place. Only one office staff member is working in the office at any given time. They are protected by a plexiglass barrier. All people in the office wear masks when not at their work station and use frequent hand washing/sanitization. 


                            <p>Patients seen in office are expected to following the following procedures.</p>

                        <p>All vaccines have the potential to cause side effects but these are rare. The scientific evidence is clear that it is safer to be vaccinated than to get COVID. The only reason not to get a COVID vaccination is having had a serious allergic reaction to a first COVID vaccination. We strongly recommend that everyone who is eligible be vaccinated.</p>
